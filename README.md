DESCRIPTION :
    Security scanning tools play a crucial role in detecting code vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with industry standards. SonarQube focuses on code quality analysis by identifying issues like bugs, code smells, and duplications. OWASP ZAP, on the other hand, is a security testing tool designed to detect vulnerabilities in web applications. Combining these tools within a CI/CD pipeline ensures that security checks are conducted consistently throughout the development lifecycle.
Python, being a versatile language, can serve as the glue to orchestrate these tools and interact with the pipeline. You can use Python scripts for initiating scans, parsing results, and automating decision-making based on security thresholds. After running these scans, parse their results to decide whether to proceed with deployment. For SonarQube, you can retrieve the analysis status using its REST API. For OWASP ZAP, you can analyze the generated reports to identify critical vulnerabilities.
